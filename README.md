# ingestd

A framework for advancing data warehousing and governance practices.

## Kafka Ingestion + Integration

Disparate data sources loaded into S3, which serves as a raw data store.

## Spark Processing

Batch processing jobs from Spark transform data to enable joining seemingly unrelated sources.

## Metadata Lake

Metadata is catalogued when it arrives in S3 and during every transformation.

## Data Versioning

Production data is snapshotted and retained for a designated period, allowing for persistent data versioning and data lineage.
